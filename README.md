# GIT knowledge base

Always create a feature local branch form DEV.__

Then after the task is done, create a pull request to DEV.__

If everyone approves PR and there is no conflicts, your branch is merged into DEV.__

When we see the app looks good on DEV, then DEV is merged into MAIN.__

MAIN is like a production environment, we don't want to necessary touch is, it's like a high-end working product :)__

DEV will be an environment for testing our changes, so the production is untouched and won't break in worst cases :D__

## Branch naming convention

If we create tasks in JIRA then:__

    /feature/*task_number*__
    
If we don't create tasks in JIRA:__

   /feature/*short_even_in_one_two_words_description_of_the_added_service*__
